Frontend of the Note's app, this part is bundle into the android app and it's the same for the webpage.
(It needs a backend to work with the database and send responses).


Why I decide to create this app?
   Well, I used to send WhatsApp messagges to myself (write them on WhatsApp Web to read them on my phone latter). This way I don't needed to type in the cellphone device.


This could (and should) be cleaned, but I think its ok for the moment.
